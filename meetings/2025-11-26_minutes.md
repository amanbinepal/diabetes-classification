# Meeting Minutes - 2025-11-26

**Milestone 2**  

Attendance: Aman, Emily, Ian, Vy

## Expectations written for milestone 2  

- Everyone should contribute equally to all aspects - how can we do?  
- Each  memory work from branches and that we shift reviews (at least one other teammate)  
- Branches allow for multiple commits on your own branch  
- Meaningful commmit messages - marked  
- Github issues - how to use?  

Discussion: Improvements from last week? 

## Fixes from Milestone 1

- [ ] Great job using branches and pull requests! I know that most of your communications will be through Slack, but please try to learn to communicate through issues as well. This is super common practice and a great way to share ideas that you might want to implement. Ideally, try to aim for 2-3 issues (or responses to issues) per person.  
- [ ] Your analysis was interesting and well documented. Remember to only do EDA on training data to avoid data leakage.  
- [ ] One small note about reproducibility: Conda-lock doesn’t keep pip-installed packages, so your conda environment (from the Conda-lock file) was missing ucimlrepo and vegafusion. To avoid this, you can try installing these packages through conda directly  
- [ ] Finally, please rename your repository to be more descriptive (e.g. something like ‘iris-classifier’). This makes it easier for other users to find you work and potentially cite it!
