    "Diabetes is a chronic disease that prevents the body from properly controlling blood sugar levels, which can lead to serious health problems including heart disease, vision loss, kidney disease, and limb amputation (Teboul, 2020). Given the severity of the disease, early detection can allow people to make lifestyle changes and receive treatment that can slow disease progression. We believe that machine learning models using survey data can offer a promising way to create accessible, cost-effective screening tools to identify high-risk individuals and support public health efforts.\n",

    "The results suggest that the baseline DummyClassifier achieves about 0.86 accuracy, since it predicts based on the most frequent class. Both Logistic Regression and LinearSVC achieve similar accuracy (approximately 0.86) with little to no improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the EDA, there is class imbalance (more non-diabetic than diabetic patients). This may affect the models’ reliability. Therefore, more analysis is needed to explore additional models, check class balance with metrics such as precision and recall, examine confusion matrices, and test different data splits or tune hyperparameters to determine if performance is stable across scenarios before drawing strong conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The similarity in test scores is an unexpected finding. With a clean dataset containing informative and diverse features, we would expect the classification models to perform at least better than the dummy classifier. Additionally, initial hyperparameter tuning for logistic regression did not affect accuracy (data not shown). This finding highlights the importance of understanding the data through EDA to interpret where accuracy scores come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests the next step for deeper EDA, including distributions, to see whether features overlap and whether the model can separate them effectively. Other future questions would be determining which features are most important for classifying an individual as diabetic or not, evaluating the probability estimates, and assessing whether all features are truly helpful for drawing conclusions."
